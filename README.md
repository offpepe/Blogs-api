## Purpose
Work skills using ORM with javascript in back-end with express.


## What was worked

- ORM logics
- Data driven behave
- data validations and transformations
- Sequelize ORM 6.2.1


## Conclusion

With this project i got that **JAVASCRIPT** does not work well with relational databases, so when using a back-end with it, i indicate mongoDb, Redis or RabbitMQ, BUT i can say that javascript isn't maded to lead with data as a Data Driven Application, cause he has only any types and in a clean api to lead with data,  we need to specify the types of every thing.
